    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A blue cheese burger is a <strong>bold</strong> twist on the traditional cheeseburger. Instead of a mild, melty slice of cheddar, the patty is topped with crumbles of blue cheese that melt into the beef as it cooks. The result is a burger with a creamy, tangy bite that balances beautifully against the rich, juicy meat.</p>
    <p>This recipe is perfect for anyone who loves strong flavors and wants to take their burger game up a notch. Serve it on a toasted bun with crisp lettuce, sweet caramelized onions, or even a touch of garlic mayo to round out the sharpness of the cheese. Whether it’s for a backyard cookout or a cozy dinner at home, this burger is hearty, flavorful, and guaranteed to impress.</p>
