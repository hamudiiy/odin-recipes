    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chocolate crinkle cookies are soft, fudgy treats with a signature crackled coating of powdered sugar. As they bake, the dough spreads and splits, revealing dark chocolate beneath the snowy white crust. The contrast in textures makes these cookies both pretty to look at and irresistible to bite into.</p>
<p>With their rich, brownie-like center and festive appearance, chocolate crinkles are a favorite during the holidays but delicious any time of year. They pair perfectly with a glass of milk or a cup of coffee, and their chewy, chocolatey goodness is sure to satisfy any sweet craving.</p>
