# odin-recipes
This is a recipe website project, where users can find the recipes for the desired foods. It aimed at sharpening my basic HTML skills, and also version control skills. I learned a lot (obviously, relatively .ha ha): How to work with texts, headings, emphasizing; working with lists (ordered and unordered); linking pages,using relative and absolute paths, internal and external links; including images (I also learned how to credit in accordance with the Creative common liscence); and it gave me hands on practice on version control using git (utilizing GitHub as well); and ,most importantly, how to research and surf the Web.
